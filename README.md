# Finite-State-Machine-Design-for-Vending-Machine-Behavior
The project "Finite State Machine Design for Vending Machine Behavior" involves the implementation of a digital vending machine controller using a finite state machine (FSM) approach. The system utilizes Verilog to model the behavior of a coin-operated vending machine, with a focus on state transitions based on user inputs and current state conditions. The FSM design ensures accurate handling of coin inputs, money accumulation, product dispensing, and change return. By leveraging the power of FSMs, the project aims to achieve an efficient and organized representation of the vending machine's behavior, facilitating the development of a robust and functional digital vending machine control system.
